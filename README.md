# Workout Tracker

# Description

For this assignment, I created a workout tracker. I was provided with the front end code and I created the back end of the app using Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handled the routes with Express.


## User Story

~~~
  As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

# Installation

* npm install
* npm run seed
* npm run start

# App Usage

A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

A user will be able to:

  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

  * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
